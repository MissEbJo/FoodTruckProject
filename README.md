# Food Truck Project


## Description
Food Truck is a program designed to get food truck info in order to make a decision for the meal they'd possibly like to have. The user would input the truck info such as name of truck, type of food & the rating. The user would then have the options listed as an average rating, the highest rated food truck, and a list of the food trucks inputed. 



##Lesson Learned
I have learned to create objects of a class, to look at the index of a for each loop. 
I have also learned to ask questions earlier when I don't fully understand a topic. 
The hardest part of the code for me was storing input from the user into an array &
 allowing the program to call upon the specific information
  that I needed outside of the array.
