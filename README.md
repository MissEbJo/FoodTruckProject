# Food Truck Project


## Description
Food Truck is a program designed to get food truck info in order to make a decision for the meal they'd possibly like to have. The user would input the truck info such as name of truck, type of food & the rating. The user would then have the options listed as an average rating, the highest rated food truck, and a list of the food trucks inputted.
